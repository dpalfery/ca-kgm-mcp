# TypeScript Coding Standards

This document defines the coding standards for TypeScript development in our project. These rules ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across the codebase.

## Purpose

To establish clear, enforceable standards that:
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Reduce bugs through type safety and testing
- Enable efficient code reviews
- Facilitate onboarding of new team members

## Scope

These standards apply to:
- All TypeScript source files (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- Frontend and backend code
- Test files
- Configuration files written in TypeScript

---

## Critical Requirements

### Type Safety

[MUST] Enable TypeScript strict mode in `tsconfig.json`.

[MUST] Explicitly type all function parameters and return values.

[MUST] Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary, and document why with a comment.

### Security

[MUST] Validate all external input (user input, API responses, file contents) before use.

[MUST] Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to source control.

---

## Recommended Practices

### Code Organization

[SHOULD] Keep files focused on a single responsibility and under 300 lines.

[SHOULD] Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and types that convey intent.

[SHOULD] Group related functionality into modules with clear, documented interfaces.

### Error Handling

[SHOULD] Handle errors explicitly rather than allowing them to propagate uncaught.

[SHOULD] Use custom error types for domain-specific errors.

[SHOULD] Log errors with appropriate context for debugging.

### Testing

[SHOULD] Write unit tests for all business logic with minimum 80% coverage.

[SHOULD] Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested and expected outcome.

[SHOULD] Mock external dependencies in unit tests.

---

## Optional Considerations

### Documentation

[MAY] Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions.

[MAY] Include inline comments for non-obvious business logic or algorithms.

### Performance

[MAY] Consider using `const` assertions for literal types to improve type inference.

[MAY] Use lazy loading for large modules that aren't always needed.
