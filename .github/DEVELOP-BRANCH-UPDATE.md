# ✨ Develop Branch & Pre-Release Gate - Implementation Complete

## 🎯 What Changed

Your GitFlow CI/CD pipeline now includes a **develop branch** with **pre-release testing and gating**. This lets you test new features before releasing to production.

## 📋 Summary of Updates

### New Workflow: Pre-Release (`prerelease.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Automatically on every `develop` push
- **Purpose**: Test pre-release versions before production
- **Publishing**: npm with beta/alpha/rc tags (NOT latest)
- **Duration**: 3-4 minutes
- **Benefits**: 
  - Users can test new features early
  - Catch issues before production release
  - Gather feedback before final release

### Updated Workflows

**PR Validation** (`pr-validation.yml`)
- Now validates PRs to: develop, main, feature/*, bugfix/*, hotfix/*
- Branch coverage expanded

**Build & Release** (`build-release.yml`)
- Now runs on PRs to both develop AND main
- Validates both staging and production releases

## 🌳 New Branch Structure

```
main (Production)
  ↑ 
  └─ release/v*.*.* ← Reviewed release branches
      ↑
develop (Staging)
  ↑ ← Automatic pre-releases to npm (beta/alpha/rc)
  ├─ feature/* ← New features
  ├─ bugfix/* ← Bug fixes  
  └─ hotfix/* ← Critical fixes (also PR to main)
```

## 🔄 Updated Development Flow

### Before
```
feature → develop ✓ → main → npm (production immediately)
```

### After (NEW)
```
feature → develop ✓ → npm (pre-release: beta)
                        ↓
                    Testing & Feedback
                        ↓
                    release → main → npm (production: latest)
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### Phase 1: Feature Development (Unchanged)
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature develop
# Make changes...
git push origin feature/my-feature
# Create PR to develop
# Get validated and approved
# Merge to develop
```

### Phase 2: Automatic Pre-Release (NEW)
```
When merged to develop:
  ↓
Pre-Release workflow triggers
  ├─ Runs full test suite
  ├─ Security audit
  ├─ Publishes to npm (beta tag)
  └─ Users can install: npm install context-iso@beta

Users test and provide feedback
```

### Phase 3: Production Release (Updated)
```
When ready to release:
  ↓
Create release PR to main
  ↓
Build & Release validation
  ↓
Merge to main
  ↓
Publish Release workflow triggers
  ├─ Publishes to npm (latest tag)
  ├─ Creates GitHub release
  └─ Sends notifications
```

## 📦 Pre-Release Tags

Your pipeline now supports three pre-release tags:

| Tag | When | Install | Notes |
|-----|------|---------|-------|
| `beta` | Automatic on develop push | `npm install context-iso@beta` | Default pre-release |
| `alpha` | Manual dispatch | `npm install context-iso@alpha` | Early preview |
| `rc` | Manual dispatch | `npm install context-iso@rc` | Release candidate |
| `latest` | Merge to main | `npm install context-iso` | Stable production |

## 🎯 Pre-Release Tag Workflow

### Automatic (Default)
1. Feature merged to develop
2. Pre-release workflow triggers
3. Publishes as `context-iso@beta` (auto-detected)
4. Users test: `npm install context-iso@beta`

### Manual (Custom Tag)
1. Go to Actions → "Pre-Release to Develop"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select tag: alpha, beta, or rc
4. Publishes with selected tag
5. Example: `npm install context-iso@rc`

## 📝 Updated Documentation

**`.github/CI-CD-QUICK-REFERENCE.md`**
- Added pre-release testing commands
- Updated development workflow examples
- Added pre-release publishing guide
- Updated branch creation procedures

## ✅ Verification

To verify the setup works:

1. **Check workflows exist**
   - `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` ✓
   - `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` ✓
   - `.github/workflows/prerelease.yml` ✓ (NEW)
   - `.github/workflows/publish-release.yml` ✓
   - `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` ✓
   - `.github/workflows/version-bump.yml` ✓

2. **Test the flow**
   ```bash
   # Create develop branch locally
   git checkout -b develop origin/develop  # or main if develop doesn't exist
   git push origin develop
   
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/test-feature develop
   # Make a change
   git commit -m "feat: test feature"
   git push origin feature/test-feature
   
   # Create PR to develop in GitHub
   # Watch: PR Validation runs automatically
   # After merge: Pre-Release workflow runs automatically
   ```

## 🎓 Updated Daily Workflow

### For Developers
```
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Make changes
3. Push and create PR
4. Wait for PR validation
5. Get approved and merge
6. ✅ Pre-release automatically published to npm (beta)
```

### For QA/Testers
```
1. Install pre-release: npm install context-iso@beta
2. Test new features
3. Report feedback or approve
```

### For Release Managers
```
1. Create release PR to main
2. Wait for build validation
3. Get approval
4. Merge to main
5. ✅ Production release automatically published (latest)
```

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Branch Protection
Make sure to configure:

**develop branch**:
- ✓ Require PR before merging
- ✓ Require 1 approval
- ✓ Require PR Validation to pass
- ✓ Require branches up to date

**main branch**:
- ✓ Require PR before merging
- ✓ Require 1 approval
- ✓ Require Build & Release to pass
- ✓ Require branches up to date

### Pre-Release Versions
- Pre-releases are **NOT** included in `npm install context-iso` by default
- Users must explicitly install pre-release: `npm install context-iso@beta`
- Keeps production users on stable versions
- QA/beta testers can opt-in to test new features

### Hotfix Procedure
After merging a hotfix to main:
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```
This keeps develop in sync with production fixes.
