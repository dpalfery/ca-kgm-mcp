# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge Graph Memory system addresses a critical challenge faced by AI coding assistants: providing comprehensive project context while managing token limits effectively. Current approaches either waste tokens by including irrelevant rules or provide insufficient context leading to inconsistent outputs. This system will use a knowledge graph-based memory approach with semantic search and domain-specific ranking to intelligently retrieve only the most relevant project rules, architectural patterns, and security requirements for each coding task.

The system aims to reduce token usage by 70-85% while improving context quality, ensuring AI coding assistants generate production-ready code that follows project-specific standards consistently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an AI coding assistant, I want the system to automatically provide relevant project rules and guidelines for my coding tasks, so that the generated code follows our project standards without me having to manually specify context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a coding task is initiated THEN the system SHALL automatically retrieve relevant project rules without manual intervention
2. WHEN rules are retrieved THEN the system SHALL include only directives applicable to the current task context
3. WHEN multiple rules apply THEN the system SHALL prioritize MUST directives over SHOULD and MAY directives
4. WHEN no specific rules apply THEN the system SHALL provide baseline security and quality guidelines

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to store our project rules in a structured knowledge graph, so that they can be automatically discovered and applied by AI coding assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rule documents are provided in markdown format THEN the system SHALL parse and store them in a knowledge graph structure
2. WHEN rules are stored THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between layers, topics, and severity levels
3. WHEN rules are updated THEN the system SHALL support incremental updates without full re-ingestion
4. WHEN rules contain directives THEN the system SHALL extract and categorize them by severity (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to query the knowledge graph for relevant directives based on task context, so that I can provide contextually appropriate guidance while staying within token limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task description is provided THEN the system SHALL detect the architectural layer (Presentation, Application, Domain, Persistence, Infrastructure)
2. WHEN a task description is provided THEN the system SHALL identify relevant topics (security, API, database, etc.)
3. WHEN context is detected THEN the system SHALL retrieve and rank directives by relevance score
4. WHEN token budget is specified THEN the system SHALL limit output to stay within the budget while prioritizing highest-ranked directives

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide context in a readable format that clearly indicates the source and importance of each directive, so that I can understand and trust the guidance provided.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN directives are returned THEN the system SHALL format them as a structured markdown block
2. WHEN directives are displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate severity level (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)
3. WHEN directives are provided THEN the system SHALL include source attribution and applicable contexts
4. WHEN multiple directives apply THEN the system SHALL organize them by importance and relevance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the knowledge graph memory system to integrate seamlessly with existing AI coding tools, so that developers can benefit from contextual guidance without changing their workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrated with coding tools THEN the system SHALL expose functionality through MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools
2. WHEN called by coding assistants THEN the system SHALL respond within 400ms for typical queries
3. WHEN the memory system is unavailable THEN coding tools SHALL gracefully fallback to baseline rules
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages and continue operation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to learn from our project structure and codebase patterns, so that the context detection becomes more accurate over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing task descriptions THEN the system SHALL use project-specific keywords and patterns for context detection
2. WHEN detecting architectural layers THEN the system SHALL achieve >80% accuracy on layer classification
3. WHEN identifying topics THEN the system SHALL extract relevant technical domains from task descriptions
4. WHEN context confidence is low THEN the system SHALL provide broader, safer rule sets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer working on different operating systems, I want the knowledge graph memory system to work consistently across platforms, so that our team can use it regardless of their development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed on Windows THEN the system SHALL function with full feature parity
2. WHEN deployed on macOS THEN the system SHALL function with full feature parity  
3. WHEN deployed on Linux THEN the system SHALL function with full feature parity
4. WHEN using different shell environments THEN the system SHALL adapt to platform-specific command structures

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible options for model providers for context detection and semantic search, so that I can choose between local models for privacy or cloud models for performance based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured for local operation THEN the system SHALL optionally support Ollama or similar local model providers
2. WHEN configured for cloud operation THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and OpenAI-compatible APIs
3. WHEN using any model provider THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable accuracy for context detection (>75%)
4. WHEN model providers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to rule-based context detection
5. WHEN switching between model providers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent API interfaces
6. WHEN no model provider is configured THEN the system SHALL operate using rule-based heuristics without requiring external dependencies

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a development team, I want to measure the effectiveness of the knowledge graph memory system, so that we can validate its impact on code quality and development efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are processed THEN the system SHALL track token usage reduction compared to baseline approaches
2. WHEN directives are retrieved THEN the system SHALL log relevance metrics and retrieval statistics
3. WHEN integrated with coding tools THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about context detection and ranking
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN the system SHALL demonstrate 70-85% token reduction while maintaining context quality
