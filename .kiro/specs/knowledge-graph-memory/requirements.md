# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a knowledge graph-based memory system for AI coding assistants that intelligently retrieves and ranks project-specific rules, architectural patterns, and security requirements. The system will extend the existing Memory MCP server to provide context-aware rule retrieval, reducing token usage by 70-85% while improving the relevance and quality of contextual information provided to AI coding tools like Roo-Cline and Cline.

The solution addresses the fundamental challenge where AI coding assistants need comprehensive project context but are limited by token constraints, forcing trade-offs between context breadth and depth.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Memory MCP Server Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using AI coding assistants, I want the system to extend the existing Memory MCP server rather than create a separate service, so that I have a unified solution for all memory and rule management needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL be a single MCP server that includes both existing Memory MCP functionality and new rule-specific capabilities
2. WHEN existing Memory MCP clients connect THEN they SHALL continue to work without any changes to their integration
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL load both the original Memory MCP tools and the new rule management tools
4. IF the Memory MCP server code is updated THEN the system SHALL be able to incorporate those updates without breaking rule functionality

### Requirement 2: Rule Document Ingestion

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to easily ingest markdown rule documents into the knowledge graph, so that our project-specific guidelines are available for AI assistants to reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide markdown rule documents THEN the system SHALL parse them and extract rules, sections, directives, and metadata
2. WHEN a rule document contains structured metadata (Layer, AuthoritativeFor, Topics, Severity) THEN the system SHALL store these as graph relationships
3. WHEN I call the upsert tool with multiple documents THEN the system SHALL process them in batch and report success/failure for each
4. IF a rule document has parsing errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issues
5. WHEN I update an existing rule document THEN the system SHALL replace the old version while preserving relationships to other entities

### Requirement 3: Context Detection Engine

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to automatically detect the architectural layer, topics, and technologies from a task description, so that I can retrieve the most relevant rules without manual categorization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a task description THEN the system SHALL detect the primary architectural layer (1-Presentation through 7-Deployment)
2. WHEN the task mentions specific technologies or frameworks THEN the system SHALL identify and tag them appropriately
3. WHEN the task description contains domain-specific keywords THEN the system SHALL extract relevant topics (security, testing, performance, API, etc.)
4. IF the detection confidence is below a threshold THEN the system SHALL return multiple possible contexts with confidence scores
5. WHEN I request context detection THEN the system SHALL respond within 200ms for typical task descriptions

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Rule Retrieval and Ranking

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to retrieve only the most relevant rules for a specific coding task, so that I can provide high-quality context without exceeding token limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query for directives with a task description THEN the system SHALL return rules ranked by relevance using the weighted scoring algorithm
2. WHEN the system ranks directives THEN it SHALL prioritize MUST directives over SHOULD and MAY directives
3. WHEN multiple directives have similar scores THEN the system SHALL prefer those marked as authoritative for the detected topics
4. IF I specify a token budget THEN the system SHALL ensure the returned context block stays within that limit
5. WHEN I request a maximum number of items THEN the system SHALL return no more than that number of top-ranked directives
6. WHEN no relevant rules are found THEN the system SHALL return a minimal set of core programming principles as fallback

### Requirement 5: Formatted Context Block Generation

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want to receive rule context in a standardized markdown format, so that I can easily prepend it to my prompts and reference specific directives in my responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system returns query results THEN it SHALL format them as a structured markdown context block
2. WHEN formatting directives THEN the system SHALL include severity level, applicable topics, and source information
3. WHEN multiple directives come from the same rule THEN the system SHALL group them logically in the output
4. IF citation information is requested THEN the system SHALL include source file paths and section references
5. WHEN the context block is generated THEN it SHALL be immediately usable as prompt context without additional formatting

### Requirement 6: MCP Tool Interface

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with coding assistants, I want standardized MCP tools for rule management, so that different AI tools can consistently access the knowledge graph functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose the `memory.rules.query_directives` tool for primary rule retrieval
2. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose the `memory.rules.detect_context` tool for standalone context analysis
3. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN it SHALL expose the `memory.rules.upsert_markdown` tool for rule document ingestion
4. WHEN any tool is called with invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL return clear error messages with parameter requirements
5. WHEN tools are called THEN they SHALL follow MCP protocol standards for request/response formatting

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a development team using the system with hundreds of rules, I want fast query responses and efficient storage, so that the system doesn't become a bottleneck in our development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying directives THEN the system SHALL respond within 400ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN the knowledge graph contains 500+ rules THEN query performance SHALL not degrade significantly
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them without blocking
4. IF the database becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide recovery options
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load and be ready to serve requests within 5 seconds

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As an AI coding assistant, I want graceful error handling when the memory system is unavailable, so that I can continue providing value to users even when the knowledge graph is not accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the memory system is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses with core programming principles
2. WHEN a query fails due to system errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and return a safe default response
3. WHEN rule parsing fails THEN the system SHALL continue processing other rules and report specific failures
4. IF the database is locked or corrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and notify administrators
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL timeout gracefully and provide meaningful error messages

### Requirement 9: Integration with Existing Coding Tools

**User Story:** As a developer using Roo-Cline or Cline, I want seamless integration with the knowledge graph memory system, so that my AI assistant automatically has access to project-specific rules without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure the MCP server in my coding tool THEN it SHALL automatically discover and register all available rule tools
2. WHEN my AI assistant starts a coding task THEN it SHALL be able to call the rule query tools without manual intervention
3. WHEN the system provides rule context THEN it SHALL be formatted for immediate use in AI assistant prompts
4. IF the MCP connection fails THEN the AI assistant SHALL continue working with reduced context rather than failing completely
5. WHEN I update rule documents THEN the changes SHALL be available to the AI assistant without restarting the MCP server
