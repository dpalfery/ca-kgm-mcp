# Implementation Plan: Knowledge Graph Memory for AI Coding Assistants

## Overview

This implementation plan converts the Knowledge Graph Memory design into a series of discrete, manageable coding tasks. The plan follows a test-driven, incremental approach that builds on the existing Memory MCP Server to create three new domain-specific tools for intelligent rule and directive retrieval.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Extend the open-source Memory MCP Server with new tools
- Build incrementally with early validation of core functionality  
- Prioritize rule-based approach first, then enhance with optional local model integration
- Ensure graceful fallbacks and cross-platform compatibility
- Focus on sub-400ms query performance and token budget management

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Memory MCP Integration

- [ ] 1.1 Set up development environment and Memory MCP Server integration
  - Clone and set up Memory MCP Server locally
  - Create extension project structure for the three new tools
  - Configure TypeScript build pipeline and dependencies
  - Set up cross-platform file path handling with Node.js path utilities
  - Verify Memory MCP Server basic functionality with existing tools
  - _Requirements: All requirements depend on this foundation_

- [ ] 1.2 Create core interfaces and type definitions
  - Define TypeScript interfaces for all MCP tool request/response types
  - Create data models for Rule, Directive, DetectedContext, and RankedDirective
  - Implement ContextDetectionConfig interface for local model configuration
  - Define error types and response structures for graceful error handling
  - Create performance metrics interfaces for monitoring
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1_

- [ ]* 1.3 Set up testing framework and initial test structure
  - Configure Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
  - Create test fixtures with sample rule documents covering all layers
  - Set up mock Memory MCP Server for isolated unit testing
  - Create test utilities for generating deterministic test data
  - _Requirements: Testing strategy validation_

### 2. Rule Document Parser and Knowledge
