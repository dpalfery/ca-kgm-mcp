# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to the project and configures KiloCode to communicate with it. The server will run in debug mode to allow step‑through debugging. The configuration for KiloCode will be added to `mcp.json`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start the MCP server in debug mode, so that I can step through its code during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the developer runs the start command in debug mode THEN the MCP server shall launch with debugger attached.
2. IF the server fails to start THEN the system shall log an error and exit with a non‑zero status.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want KiloCode to know how to reach the MCP server, so that it can invoke its tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN KiloCode reads `mcp.json` THEN it shall contain a `servers` entry with the new MCP server name, host, and port.
2. IF the `mcp.json` file is missing or malformed THEN KiloCode shall report a clear configuration error.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to expose its tools via a defined schema, so that KiloCode can call them correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a tool request is received over HTTP THEN the MCP server shall validate the request against the tool schema and execute the tool.
2. IF validation fails THEN the server shall return a 400 response with details.
