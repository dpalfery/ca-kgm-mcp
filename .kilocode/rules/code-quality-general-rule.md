## Build Quality

### Zero Tolerance Policy
- Fix all build errors immediately. No exceptions.
- Resolve all warnings before merging or deploying.
- Treat warnings as errors in CI/CD to prevent technical debt.
- Never Ever hard code mock testing data in production code.
- Only one object, class, interface, enum per file. never add two objects to a file, yuck!

### Configuration & Monitoring
- Set warning and error policies in project configuration files.
- Document the justification for any suppressed warnings.
- Implement CI/CD quality gates that fail on errors or warnings.
- Generate build reports that track warning trends and raise alerts.

### Development Workflow
- Configure IDEs to surface violations as warnings or errors.
- Enable auto-format on save and enforce formatting via pre-commit hooks.

### Enforcement
- Fail local builds on errors or violations.
- Archive CI/CD quality reports and block PRs that introduce new warnings.
- Require zero warnings at code review and document any accepted suppressions.

## Validation

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server.
- Sanitize and normalize inputs before use.
- Enforce server-side validation for all public endpoints.

### Error Handling
- Return consistent error responses across all APIs.
- Use appropriate status codes for error conditions.
- Keep error messages useful but do not expose sensitive system details.
- Handle exceptions gracefully and log sanitized diagnostic information.

### Security Cross-Reference
- For security-specific validation, input-escaping, secrets handling, authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and incident logging, follow the authoritative security rules in [`security-general-rule.md`](.kilocode/rules/security-general-rule.md:1).

## Observability

### Structured Logging
- Use structured logging with semantic properties.
- Configure logging providers per environment.
- Log at appropriate levels: Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical.
- Use message templates and properties when logging structured data.
- For incident-response logging requirements (correlation IDs, retention, and forensic detail), follow [`security-general-rule.md`](.kilocode/rules/security-general-rule.md:1).

### Metrics
- Implement metrics collection for key KPIs: response times, error rates, throughput.
- Configure exporters for monitoring dashboards.

### Tracing
- Implement distributed tracing for request flows.
- Include contextual metadata in trace spans.

### Implementation Guidelines
- Configure observability during application startup.
- Use consistent naming for metrics and traces.
- Implement health checks that surface observability status.

## Testing Standards and Coverage Requirements

### Test Coverage Standards
- Application and Domain layers: Minimum 80% code coverage.
- Infrastructure/Persistence layer: Minimum 70% code coverage.
- Presentation layer: Minimum 60% code coverage.
- Frontend components: Minimum 70% coverage for critical user interactions.
- Mobile app: Minimum 65% coverage for core functionality.

### Test Organization
- Place tests in appropriate test directories following project structure.
- Use descriptive test class and method names.
- Group related tests in test classes.
- Separate unit, integration, and performance tests.

### Test Data Management
- Use factory methods for test data creation.
- Implement builder patterns for complex objects.
- Avoid hard-coded test data; use data builders.
- Clean up test resources in test teardown.

## Code Review Quality Gates

### Automated Checks
- Ensure builds pass without warnings.
- Ensure all tests pass.
- Ensure code coverage meets requirements.
- Ensure static analysis tools pass.
