# Test Data for Knowledge Graph Memory System

This directory contains sample rule documents and test datasets for validating the Knowledge Graph Memory system functionality.

## Structure

- `sample-rules/` - Comprehensive rule document examples covering different architectural layers and domains
- `test-datasets/` - Structured test data for automated testing
- `generators/` - Utilities for generating additional test data

## Sample Rule Documents

The sample rules demonstrate the full range of rule document formats and cover:

- All architectural layers (Presentation, Application, Domain, Persistence, Infrastructure)
- Various domains (security, API design, database, testing, performance)
- Different severity levels (MUST, SHOULD, MAY)
- Complex relationships and cross-references

## Test Datasets

Test datasets include:

- Task descriptions for context detection validation
- Expected outputs for ranking algorithm testing
- Performance benchmarking data
- Edge case scenarios

## Usage

These files are used by:

1. Integration tests to validate end-to-end functionality
2. Performance benchmarks to measure system efficiency
3. Accuracy validation for context detection and ranking
4. Development and debugging of new features
