### Supporting Files

5. **`integration-test-runner.ts`** - Test execution and reporting
   - Runs all integration tests
   - Generates comprehensive reports
   - Validates requirement compliance

6. **`test-data-validator.ts`** - Test environment validation
   - Ensures required test data exists
   - Validates environment setup
   - Creates missing sample files

## Quick Start

### 1. Validate Environment

```bash
npm run validate
```

This will:
- Check Node.js version and dependencies
- Validate source code structure
- Create missing test data files
- Ensure environment is ready for testing

### 2. Run All Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:task-10-4
```

This executes the comprehensive test suite and generates a detailed report covering all Task 10.4 requirements.

### 3. Run Individual Test Suites

```bash
# MCP protocol compliance only
npm run test:integration:mcp

# Real-world scenarios only  
npm run test:integration:scenarios

# Comprehensive integration tests only
npm run test:integration:comprehensive

# All integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

## Test Coverage

### System Integration with Coding Assistants (Requirement 5.1)

- ✅ MCP tool registration and discovery
- ✅ Seamless workflow integration
- ✅ Response time requirements (<400ms)
- ✅ Error handling and graceful degradation
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms when system unavailable

### MCP Protocol Compliance (Requirement 5.1)

- ✅ Tool interface specification compliance
- ✅ JSON schema validation for inputs/outputs
- ✅ Proper response format (MCP content blocks)
- ✅ Parameter validation and error handling
- ✅ Optional parameter handling
- ✅ Concurrent request handling

### Real-World Usage Scenarios (Requirements 5.1-5.4)

- ✅ Complete development lifecycle workflows
- ✅ Multi-layer architecture scenarios
- ✅ Enterprise-scale rule sets (50+ rules)
- ✅ Token usage reduction (70-85% requirement)
- ✅ Cross-layer directive ranking
- ✅ Different coding assistant modes (architect, debug, code)

### Performance and Reliability (Requirements 5.2-5.4)

- ✅ Response time under 400ms (95th percentile)
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Large rule set performance (1000+ directives)
- ✅ Token budget enforcement
- ✅ Graceful degradation scenarios
- ✅ Error recovery and meaningful error messages

## Test Data

The tests use sample rule documents covering all architectural layers:

- **Presentation Layer Rules** - UI, components, accessibility
- **Application Layer Rules** - Business logic, APIs, authentication  
- **Domain Layer Rules** - Business entities, domain logic
- **Persistence Layer Rules** - Database queries, transactions
- **Infrastructure Layer Rules** - Deployment, monitoring, security

Test data is automatically created by the validator if missing.

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria

All tests should pass with the following validations:

1. **MCP Protocol Compliance**: ✅ PASS
   - All tools implement required MCP interface
   - Responses follow MCP format specification
   - Input validation works correctly

2. **System Integration**: ✅ PASS  
   - Seamless integration with coding assistants
   - No workflow disruption
   - Fast response times (<400ms)

3. **Real-World Scenarios**: ✅ PASS
   - Complete development workflows work
   - Token reduction meets requirements (70-85%)
   - Performance scales with enterprise rule sets

4. **Performance Requirements**: ✅ PASS
   - All queries complete within 400ms
   - System handles concurrent requests
   - Graceful degradation under failure

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Query Response Time**: <400ms (95th percentile)
- **Token Reduction**: 70-85% compared to baseline
- **Concurrent Requests**: 20+ simultaneous queries
- **Rule Set Scale**: 50+ rules, 200+ directives
- **Context Detection Accuracy**: >80% for layer detection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run validate
   ```

2. **Test Data Missing**
   ```bash
   npm run validate
   ```

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Check system resources
   - Reduce concurrent test load
   - Verify database performance

4. **MCP Compliance Failures**
   - Check tool interface implementations
   - Verify response format compliance
   - Validate input schema definitions

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
npm run test:integration -- --reporter=verbose
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    npm run validate
    npm run test:task-10-4
```

The test runner exits with appropriate codes:
- `0` - All tests passed, requirements validated
- `1` - Tests failed or requirements not met

## Reporting

The integration test runner generates detailed reports:

- **Console Output** - Real-time test progress and summary
- **JSON Report** - Detailed results saved to `integration-test-report.json`
- **Requirement Validation** - Specific validation of Task 10.4 requirements

## Contributing

When adding new integration tests:

1. Follow existing test patterns and structure
2. Include requirement traceability comments
3. Add performance benchmarks where applicable
4. Update this README with new test coverage
5. Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable
