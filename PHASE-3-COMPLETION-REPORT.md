## Technical Implementation

### 1. Scoring Engine

**Features:**
- Configurable weighted scoring (weights must sum to 1.0)
- Severity scoring: MUST=100, SHOULD=50, MAY=25
- Relevance scoring: exact=100, keyword=60, fuzzy=30
- Layer scoring: exact=100, adjacent=50, close=30, distant=10
- Topic scoring: +20 per match (max 100)
- Technology scoring: +25 per match (max 100)
- Authoritativeness: 100 if authoritative, 0 otherwise

**Default Weights:**
```typescript
{
  severity: 0.30,        // 30%
  relevance: 0.25,       // 25%
  layerMatch: 0.20,      // 20%
  topicMatch: 0.15,      // 15%
  techMatch: 0.05,       // 5%
  authoritativeness: 0.05 // 5%
}
```

**Mode Adjustments:**
- Architect: Boosts architecture (1.5x), design (1.5x), scalability (1.2x)
- Code: Boosts testing (1.3x), coding standards (1.5x), performance (1.1x)
- Debug: Boosts error-handling (1.5x), logging (1.3x), debugging (1.5x)

### 2. Token Counter

**Features:**
- Conservative token estimation (~4 chars/token + word boundaries)
- Budget filtering with reserve tokens for formatting
- Severity-based allocation (MUST → SHOULD → MAY)
- Format overhead calculation (headers, metadata, citations)
- Token statistics (total, average, min, max, median)

**Typical Overhead:**
```
Header:        ~10 tokens
Metadata:      ~50 tokens
Citations:     ~20 tokens per section
Section headers: ~15 tokens per section
Footer:        ~30 tokens

Total: ~125-150 tokens for typical context block
```

### 3. Ranking Engine

**Features:**
- Neo4j Cypher query building based on context
- Score application and sorting
- Multi-criteria filtering (severity, layer, topics, tech)
- Token budget integration
- Mode adjustment integration
- Comprehensive statistics reporting

**Query Strategy:**
```cypher
MATCH (d:Directive)
OPTIONAL MATCH (r:Rule)-[:HAS_DIRECTIVE]->(d)
WHERE [dynamic conditions]
RETURN d, r
LIMIT 100
```

### 4. Context Block Format

```markdown
# Contextual Rules

**Detected Context:**
- Layer: 5-Integration
- Topics: security, api
- Keywords: authentication, jwt

## Critical (MUST) Directives

### Security Guidelines → Authentication
- **[MUST]** All API endpoints must require authentication using JWT tokens
  *Applies to: security, api*
  *Source: Security Guidelines → Authentication*
  *Score: 87.3%*

## Recommended (SHOULD) Directives

### Performance Guidelines → Caching
- **[SHOULD]** Implement caching for frequently accessed data
  *Applies to: performance, database*
  *Source: Performance Guidelines → Caching*
  *Score: 65.2%*

## Optional (MAY) Directives

### Documentation Guidelines → API Docs
- **[MAY]** Document API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger
  *Applies to: documentation, api*
  *Source: Documentation Guidelines → API Docs*
  *Score: 45.0%*

- ✅ RuleManager - Updated `queryDirectives()` method
- ⏳ Phase 2 (Pending) - Context detection ready for integration

---

## Demo Results

The demo (`demo-phase3.mjs`) successfully demonstrates:

1. **Basic Scoring** - Different contexts produce different rankings
2. **Mode Adjustments** - Scores change based on operational mode
3. **Token Budget** - Smart allocation within constraints
4. **Severity Prioritization** - MUST directives prioritized over SHOULD/MAY
5. **Context Block** - Complete formatted output

Sample output shows 87.3% score for highly relevant MUST directive vs 30.5% for less relevant MAY directive.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Context Detection**: Currently uses placeholder detection (awaits Phase 2)
2. **Technology Detection**: Not yet integrated (awaits Phase 2)
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Basic implementation (awaits Phase 2)
4. **Token Estimation**: Approximate (~10% variance from actual)

These limitations are expected and will be addressed in Phase 2.
