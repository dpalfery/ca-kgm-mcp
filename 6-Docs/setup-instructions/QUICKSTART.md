## Where's My Neo4j Information?

1. Go to [Neo4j Aura Console](https://console.neo4j.io/)
2. Find your instance (status should be "Running")
3. Click **"Details"**
4. Copy the three pieces of info:
   - **URI**: `neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`
   - **Username**: `neo4j` (usually)
   - **Password**: Your secure password

That's all you need!

## Already Have Credentials?

Edit `.env` manually:

```bash
notepad .env
```

Add your credentials:
```
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password-here
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

## Test Coverage

| Area | Tests |
|------|-------|
| Database Connection | 3 |
| Entity Management | 5 |
| Relationships | 3 |
| Search | 3 |
| Analytics | 3 |
| Error Handling | 3 |
| Performance | 2 |
| **TOTAL** | **22** |

## What Gets Tested?

✅ **Can connect to Neo4j Aura**  
✅ **Can create database schema**  
✅ **Can create/read/update/delete entities**  
✅ **Can create and traverse relationships**  
✅ **Can search entities**  
✅ **Can calculate graph analytics**  
✅ **Can handle errors gracefully**  
✅ **Performance is acceptable**  

## Troubleshooting

### "Credentials not configured"
- Check `.env` file exists
- Check it has actual values (not "your-instance")

### "Failed to connect"
- Go to https://console.neo4j.io/
- Check your instance shows "Running"
- If paused, click "Resume"

### "Authentication failed"
- Copy password again from Aura (must be exact)
- Check no typos in URI

## Success Indicators

✅ All 22 tests pass  
✅ Performance < 15 seconds  
✅ No errors in output  
✅ "Test Files 1 passed (1)" shows at end

## Commands

```bash
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests (mocked, no DB)
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests (live DB)
npm run test:all          # Both
npm run test:watch        # Watch mode
npm run build             # Compile TypeScript
```

## Time Estimate

- Setup credentials: **1 minute**
- Running tests: **15-20 seconds**
- Reviewing results: **2 minutes**
- **Total: ~5 minutes**

## Next Steps After Tests Pass

✅ **Phase 6**: Implement rule management  
✅ **Phase 7**: Add vector search  
✅ **Deployment**: Build Docker, deploy to cloud
