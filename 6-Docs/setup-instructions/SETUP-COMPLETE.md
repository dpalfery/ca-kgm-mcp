## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```powershell
cd c:\git\ca-kgm-mcp
.\neo4j-integration-test.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Ask for your Neo4j credentials
2. Create `.env` file
3. Run all 22 tests
4. Display results

**Time: ~5 minutes**

### Option 2: Manual Setup

```bash
# 1. Get credentials from https://console.neo4j.io/

# 2. Edit .env file
notepad .env
# Add your credentials

# 3. Run tests
npm run test:integration
```

**Time: ~5 minutes**

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **What's Protected:**
- `.env` file is Git-ignored
- Credentials stored locally only
- No secrets in code
- No hardcoded URIs/passwords
- Environment variables only

❌ **What to Avoid:**
- Don't commit `.env` to Git
- Don't share credentials
- Don't hardcode secrets
- Don't store passwords in logs

## ⏱️ Performance Expectations

| Operation | Target | Typical |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Single entity create | < 50ms | ~30-40ms |
| Bulk create (50) | < 2s | ~1.2-1.8s |
| Full-text search | < 500ms | ~200-400ms |
| Graph traversal | < 1s | ~300-600ms |
| Complete test suite | < 20s | ~15s |

*Note: Free tier may have rate limiting; premium faster*

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Credentials not configured" | Edit `.env` with real values |
| "Failed to connect" | Check instance is "Running" at https://console.neo4j.io/ |
| "Authentication failed" | Verify password matches exactly |
| Tests timeout | Check internet connection |
| "CONSTRAINT already exists" | Normal - expected behavior |
