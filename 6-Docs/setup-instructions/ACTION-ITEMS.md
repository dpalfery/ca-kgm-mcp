## What You Need to Do

### 👤 Step 1: Get Your Neo4j Aura Credentials (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.neo4j.io/
2. Find your instance (should show green "Running" indicator)
3. Click "Details" 
4. Copy three items:
   - **Connection URI**: `neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`
   - **Username**: `neo4j`
   - **Password**: Your secure password

### ⚙️ Step 2: Configure Your Environment (2 minutes)

**Option A - Automatic (Recommended):**
```powershell
cd c:\git\ca-kgm-mcp
.\neo4j-integration-test.ps1
```
Then answer the prompts with your credentials.

**Option B - Manual:**
```powershell
# Edit .env file
notepad .env

# Add your credentials:
# NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
# NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
# NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password

# Save and close
```

### 🧪 Step 3: Run Integration Tests (30 seconds)

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

Or if using automatic setup, tests run automatically.

### ✅ Step 4: Verify Success

You should see:
```
✓ src/integration.test.ts (22)
  ✓ Connectivity and Schema (3)
  ✓ Entity Management (5)
  ✓ Relationship Management (3)
  ✓ Search Functionality (3)
  ✓ Graph Analytics (3)
  ✓ Error Handling (3)
  ✓ Performance and Scale (2)

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  22 passed (22)
   Duration  ~15s
```

**If you see this: ✅ SUCCESS!**

## Immediate Next Steps

### 📚 Read Documentation (Optional but Recommended)

If tests work, you're done! But for reference:
- **Quick overview**: QUICKSTART.md (5 min)
- **Complete guide**: INTEGRATION-TESTING-STEPS.md (15 min)
- **Architecture**: ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md (10 min)

### 🚀 If Tests Fail

Check troubleshooting section in:
- TEST-EXECUTION.md - Quick troubleshooting
- INTEGRATION-TESTING-SETUP.md - Detailed solutions

Most common issues:
1. Wrong credentials → Copy again from Aura
2. Instance paused → Go to https://console.neo4j.io/ and resume
3. .env not configured → Run `.\neo4j-integration-test.ps1`

## Commands Reference

```bash
# One-command setup (recommended)
.\neo4j-integration-test.ps1

# Manual test run
npm run test:integration

# Unit tests only (don't need Neo4j)
npm run test:unit

# All tests
npm run test:all

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Build project
npm run build
```

---

## Files You'll Need to Edit

Just one file:

📝 **`.env`** - Your Neo4j Aura credentials
```
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

That's it! Everything else is pre-configured.

## What Gets Tested

```
Connectivity       ✓ Can connect to Neo4j
Schema             ✓ Constraints created
Entities           ✓ Create, read, update, delete
Relationships      ✓ Link and traverse
Search             ✓ Find entities
Analytics          ✓ Calculate statistics
Performance        ✓ Speed benchmarks
Error Handling     ✓ Graceful failures
```

All 22 tests validate these areas.

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Credentials not configured" | Edit `.env` with real values |
| "Failed to connect" | Check instance is "Running" at https://console.neo4j.io/ |
| "Authentication failed" | Copy password again (must be exact) |
| Tests timeout | Check internet connection |
| "CONSTRAINT already exists" | Normal - this is expected |

---

## What Happens After Tests Pass

You have a fully validated:
- ✅ Neo4j database connection
- ✅ TypeScript MCP server
- ✅ Entity management system
- ✅ Relationship management
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Graph analytics

**Next phases:**
1. Phase 6: Implement rule management
2. Phase 7: Add vector search
3. Deployment to production

## Estimated Total Time

| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| Get credentials | 2 min |
| Configure environment | 2 min |
| Run tests | 1 min |
| Review results | 2 min |
| **TOTAL** | **~7 minutes** |
