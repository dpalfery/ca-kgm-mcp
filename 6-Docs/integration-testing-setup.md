# Integration Testing Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up and running integration tests against your live Neo4j Aura instance.

## Prerequisites

‚úÖ Neo4j Aura account created  
‚úÖ Free tier instance provisioned  
‚úÖ Connection credentials obtained  

## Step 1: Get Your Neo4j Aura Credentials

1. Go to [Neo4j Aura Console](https://console.neo4j.io/)
2. Click on your instance (should be in "Running" state)
3. Click **"Details"** to view connection information
4. You'll see:
   - **URI**: `neo4j+s://xxxxx.databases.neo4j.io`
   - **Username**: `neo4j` (default)
   - **Password**: Your temporary password (shown only once at creation)

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Copy your credentials from Neo4j Aura
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance-id.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-password-here
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notes:**
- Never commit `.env` to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Regenerate passwords periodically through Neo4j Aura console
- Use separate credentials for dev/test/prod environments

## Step 3: Run Tests

### Option A: Run Integration Tests Only

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

This runs the comprehensive test suite against your live Neo4j instance:

- **Connectivity Tests**: Verify database connection
- **Schema Validation**: Check constraints and indexes
- **Entity Management**: Create, read, update, delete operations
- **Relationship Management**: Create and traverse relationships
- **Search Functionality**: Full-text search validation
- **Graph Analytics**: Statistics and pattern analysis
- **Performance Tests**: Bulk operations and response times

### Option B: Run Unit Tests (Mocked)

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

Tests MemoryManager with mocked Neo4j driver (no live connection needed).

### Option C: Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:all
```

Runs both unit tests and integration tests in sequence.

## Step 4: Interpret Results

Successful integration test output will show:

```
‚úì src/integration.test.ts (X)
  ‚úì Connectivity and Schema (3)
    ‚úì connects to Neo4j Aura successfully
    ‚úì creates and validates schema constraints
    ‚úì creates and validates search indexes
  ‚úì Entity Management (5)
    ‚úì creates multiple entities via memory manager
    ‚úì retrieves entities and validates structure
    ‚úì updates existing entities
    ‚úì deletes entities by pattern
    ‚úì ...

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  XX passed (XX)
```

### Common Issues & Troubleshooting

#### ‚ùå "Neo4j Aura credentials not configured"

**Solution:**
1. Verify `.env` file exists in project root
2. Check all three variables are set (URI, USERNAME, PASSWORD)
3. Ensure no typos in variable names
4. Restart your terminal/VS Code to reload environment

```bash
# Verify environment variables are loaded
npm run test:integration 2>&1 | head -20
```

#### ‚ùå "Failed to connect to Neo4j"

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect URI (copy exactly from Aura console)
- Wrong username or password
- Neo4j instance is paused/stopped (check Aura console)
- Firewall/network blocking connection (unlikely with Aura cloud)

**Solution:**
1. Test credentials manually:
```powershell
$env:NEO4J_URI = "neo4j+s://..."
$env:NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
$env:NEO4J_PASSWORD = "..."
npm run test:integration
```

2. Check instance status in [Neo4j Aura Console](https://console.neo4j.io/)
   - Should show "Running" with green indicator
   - If paused, click "Resume"

#### ‚ùå "Authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Verify password is exactly as shown in Aura console
2. Copy-paste password instead of typing to avoid typos
3. Check if special characters need escaping
4. Reset password through Aura console if needed

#### ‚ùå "CONSTRAINT ... already exists"

This is expected if tests ran before. Neo4j prevents duplicate constraints.
Tests automatically handle this with `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses.

## Step 5: Verify Test Data Cleanup

Tests automatically:
1. ‚úÖ Create a clean database at test start
2. ‚úÖ Run all operations
3. ‚úÖ Delete all test data at completion

To verify cleanup completed:

```powershell
# Check node count (should be 0 after tests)
$env:NEO4J_URI = "..."
$env:NEO4J_USERNAME = "neo4j"
$env:NEO4J_PASSWORD = "..."

# Using cypher command (if neo4j-cli installed)
neo4j-cli query "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) AS nodes"

# Or manually check in Neo4j Browser: http://localhost:7474/
```

## Step 6: Advanced Configuration

### Connection Pool Tuning

For high-throughput scenarios, adjust in `.env`:

```bash
NEO4J_MAX_POOL_SIZE=100
NEO4J_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=60000
```

### Running Tests in Watch Mode

For development iteration:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

This reruns tests whenever you modify files.

## Step 7: Next Steps

Once integration tests pass, you can:

1. **Implement Rule Management** (Phase 6)
   - Complete `queryDirectives()` implementation
   - Build context detection engine
   - Add markdown rule parsing

2. **Add Vector Search** (Phase 7)
   - Integrate embedding model
   - Implement semantic search queries
   - Optimize vector indexes

3. **Deploy MCP Server**
   - Build Docker container with Neo4j driver
   - Deploy to cloud platform (Azure Container Apps, AWS Lambda, etc.)
   - Configure authentication for MCP clients

## Test Coverage Summary

| Test Suite | Count | Type | Coverage |
|-----------|-------|------|----------|
| Connectivity | 3 | Integration | Database connection, schema, indexes |
| Entity Management | 5 | Integration | CRUD operations, structure validation |
| Relationships | 3 | Integration | Creation, traversal, graph queries |
| Search | 3 | Integration | Full-text, type-based, keyword search |
| Analytics | 3 | Integration | Statistics, connectivity, patterns |
| Error Handling | 3 | Integration | Edge cases, missing data, duplicates |
| Performance | 2 | Integration | Bulk operations, response times |
| **Total** | **22** | | **100% Happy Path + Error Cases** |

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance on Neo4j Aura free tier:

| Operation | Expected Duration |
|-----------|------------------|
| Entity Creation (single) | < 50ms |
| Bulk Entity Creation (50) | < 2000ms |
| Full-Text Search | < 500ms |
| Graph Traversal | < 1000ms |
| Schema Creation | < 5000ms |

*Note: Free tier has rate limiting; premium tiers perform significantly faster*

## Support & Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

In integration.test.ts or your application:

```typescript
import neo4j from 'neo4j-driver';

const driver = neo4j.driver(uri, auth, {
  logging: neo4j.logging.console('DEBUG')
});
```

### Check Neo4j Server Logs

In [Neo4j Aura Console](https://console.neo4j.io/):
1. Click your instance
2. Go to **"Logs"** tab
3. View query logs and performance metrics

### Query Performance

Use Neo4j Browser for detailed query analysis:

```cypher
EXPLAIN MATCH (e:Entity)-[r:RELATES_TO]-(other) 
RETURN e, r, other LIMIT 10
```
